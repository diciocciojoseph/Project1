Unit and Integration Tests:

Tests will be run using a "black-box" method, the program will be run, and the inputs given will be detailed
in the test cases. The cases will look to test as many sub-domains of the test domain using representative cases.
Program execution input and output screenshots will be provided for each test (see test_output directory).

UNIT TESTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 1: Creating new Traveler Profiles
Use the Enter New Profile option to create a few new profiles, making sure to test all significant aspects of the menu

Profile 1
(input sequence after initial program execution)

The profiles should be created without error using the menu interface options.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 2: Finding a Traveler Profile
See if we can use the Find Profile option to find our created profiles
(already in the menu interface options)

Finding the first profile:

DiCioccio
TA1

Finding the second profile:
2
Sze
TA2

You should see the corresponding profile information output for each profile.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 3.a: Deleting a Traveler Profile with the correct agentID
First display all the profiles, then if we delete profile 2 and display all again it should be gone

(on program execution)

TA2

Test 3.b: Deleting a Traveler Profile with the incorrect agentID, then updating ID to delete successfully
First display all profiles (should just be profile 1 now), but if we try to delete the profile it will not work
this is because we did not create the first profile under TA2, we created it under TA1, so it shouldn't work
After changing our agentID to TA1 it should work and all profiles should be gone

Afterwards both profiles should be successfully deleted. This demonstrates the constraint that profiles can only
be deleted by their creator.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 4: Updating an existing profile
Take an existing profile and use the update menu option to update multiple profile fields

(already in menu interface options)

After updating, you find the profile and the updated values should be there.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 5: Displaying all profiles
Use the display all profile option to show all the profiles, it should display profile1 and profile2 created

(from menu interface)
5

The two profiles should be shown
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test 6: Persistent Data Test
After the program initially starts, we should be able to find all profiles if they were saved before

(on program start)
TA1
5

Without entering any new profile information, we are able to see the profiles (they were loaded on program start)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION TESTS - see input/output in screenshots
These tests are meant to see how the program performs when doing multiple operations sequentially,
again in a black box fashion we are using the interface as intended and seeing if any problems arise
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a profile
2. Update the phone number field
3. Exit program / Restart Program
4. Find the profile
5. Delete the profile
4. Find the profile

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 8

1. Create two profiles
3. display all profiles
4. Exit program / Restart program
5. Find the second profile
6. Delete the first profile
